## 🧪 Test the Backend API

You can test the face spoof detection API using the following Python script:

```python
import base64
import requests

image_path = r"C:\Users\sanga\Downloads\archive\LCC_FASD\LCC_FASD_evaluation\spoof\spoof_944.png"

with open(image_path, "rb") as img_file:
    encoded_img = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
    base64_img = f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{encoded_img}"

api_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/detect/"

response = requests.post(api_url, json={"image": base64_img})

print("Response:", response.json())

✅ Make sure your Django server is running before executing the script.
